# MUSR
### GA WDI London - Project 2
#### Playlist maker

A fully RESTful web application built with HTMl, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, Node.js/Express, and MongoDB.

[Check it out here.](https://musr.herokuapp.com)

#### The app
After creating an account, users can create their own playlists (with video) on Musr. To add a song, simply type in the song name and artist to perform a search through the YouTube API and click on the video you want.

#### Problems and challenges
* Trying to get the YouTube video to display songs in a playlist format rather than an individual video for each song

#### Future
* Add another API as a song source, such as SoundCloud (strict access) or Spotify
